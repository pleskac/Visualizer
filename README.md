# Visualizer #

## Arduino ##

This is where the LEDs are controled individually. With RGB LEDs I need at least three pins for one box. I'll quickly run out, therefore I may need a master Arduino to control serial I/O that send compressed data to slave arduinos which control around 3 RGB LEDs.

## Raspbery Pi + GO ##

This will be the core of the visualizing algorithm. This will be where the heavy processing occurs.

## Front End ##

To Be Determined. May start with web, desktop application, or mobile app. No lo se.

This is very lightweight and is only for changing effects/colors/patterns/etc.
